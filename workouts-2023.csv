Had caught and passed a group on the first big descent, then a few more on the first little climb out, but then one of those riders passed me again on the gravel descent. Fell off the group at the start—about mile 5, but slowly caught riders as soon as it switched to singletrack. Was starting to fatigue on second big climb (mostly due to back pain and heat), but tried to set it in tempo and stay steady. Felt like I rode the singletrack well for being blind on most of it. The last section especially was super tight and twisty and would have been much faster if I knew where I was going Missed my first feed, which didn’t help the feelings of overheating…just was not used to the heat or being in full sun for so long.*","5.08555459976196","4.28000020980835","","80","","158","176","","","0.691358630574923","242.56","12","56","100","148","16","0","","","","","137","70","49","29","13","8","","","","","9","3"
