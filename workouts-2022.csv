It is a punching force, with lots of power moves to get over roots especially when wet. The first climb is pretty steep gravel going into the trail, then about five or six steep switchbacks till it levels out the first time.

That 5 mile road start with the crazy hill to start it is terrible for someone like me in a mass start. I got behind an enormous congo line of riders going into the singletrack and got stopped up more times that I can count. Small successes: I rode the rock garden and super steep hill in the Mohican SP without getting stopped. I ran out of water before Aid 2, so had to make an unplanned (but definitely smart) stop there for more bottles. My handlebars came loose, so stopped again to fix those and re-tighten my stem plate. Slid out and crashed on a root that I had plenty of traction over while pre-riding…. I had zero rear wheel traction (note: don’t ride the Rekon Race in slimy conditions. It’s useless). Chose to run the Mohican wilderness rock garden based on pre-ride, and was pretty much just spitting mad by time I popped out at aid 3. Ate some chips, drank an icee, got my glasses cleaned and chain lubed (thanks Aaron!) and felt generally better going into the last 1/3 of the race. Gave it everything I had, but still didn’t see any more women and suspected I was so far back from my slow pull through the state park that I didn’t have any chance at the podium, but figured I was going to “go for the brick” anyway and leave it all out there. Ended in 3rd. Other side note re: fit. I can get into a comfortable aero position on my hardtail, but cannot fit into that position on the Epic. Togs were helpful, but not really game changers. Need to try different grips (maybe Ergon or ESI super chunky) to alleviate blistering on outer palms.*","6.81619596481323","4.24900007247925","","82","","146","169","","","0.784781074985387","419.22","0","10","4","22","179","194","0","","","","177","64","54","47","30","36","","","","","8","7"

Then for whatever reason I couldn't get back into my pedal....fought with it for the entire next section of trail before I finally got clipped back in...which meant I got dropped WAY off the back. Finally got pedaling again and was feeling good and sending it, then crashed HARD on a muddy descent. Again, got back up and kept riding. Even rode the rock garden no problems (with my bars crooked!). Stopped at pits to let Steve straighten my bars. Had to step down on ""P"" when I got off-line. Lost traction on ensuing climb and had to walk again. So frustrating. Nailed the descent that I crashed on the first time. Stepped down on rock garden when getting off line.
