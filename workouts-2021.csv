Ended up holding fifth place heading into the single track. I crashed at about mile five or six, by sliding out on a damp corner. Recovered myself and held steady through the single track. Two girls passed me putting me back in sixth right after I crashed and was getting up again, but I moved back into fifth place a bit further into the single track. We rode nearly all of the state park trails before dumping into a muddy horse trail. Overall, there was way more singletrack than I expected. Everything outside of the state park was slightly wet and full of super slimy and Marcy rocks. Apparently it was the hardest mohicaan course ever, and had about 18 miles more single track than it traditionally does. I got a little confused on the eight stations, and was out of water going through aid station to, but thought that it was number three… Then three was about 5 miles further than I expected, so by time I got there, I was very dry. I ate a waffle about 4 miles from that aid station, and my stomach totally nodded up and started cramping. When I got to the east station, I stopped long enough to drink and icy, and an entire bottle of water before moving on. I had Elizabeth there to give me a fresh pack and two new bottles for the bike. From that point, I slowly came back to life. On the Gravel sections, I try to find guys to draft behind. There was one guy from Dayton that I rode with for probably five or 6 miles until I dropped him on a climb. He eventually caught me right at the finish and we rode in together. As a whole, I think I manage the fueling in nutrition well. I should have, in retrospect, stopped at a station to for a fresh bottle. I also should have carried something salty to combat palate fatigue throughout the race… As by the end I was just force-feeding myselfChoose as I couldn’t even stomach anything else, but knew I needed the fuel.* *06/07/2021 Abigail Snyder: For fuel: Osmo Pre-Load during warm up with mini-Clif bar.

Probably went too hard in the Crit the night before—power just wasn’t there. Fell apart mentally (mostly due to fear) and physically, but managed to bring it back. Stem loosened and bars rotated… no pre-ride of course meant lots of guesswork and cognitive load… dropped a bottle in the feed zone. Lots of struggle-bussing. Probably should have run ground control tires. Probably should have eaten/drank more (only made it through 1.5 bottles and 1/2 a hydration pack). Definitely should have left the knee warmers on. Knees still achy the next day from the cold—didn’t warm up legs until more than halfway… even though I felt decent during warm up, that first gravel section is too fast too quick… and cold.*","4.9229040145874","4.41900014877319","","84","","149","167","","","0.725354611585492","258.34","0","2","3","12","112","165","0","","","","137","44","37","27","20","19","5","","","","9","9"
