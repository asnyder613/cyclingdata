# cyclingdata
Personal project to practice data science skills on my own cycling workout data from 2018-2023

Initial questions include:
- What is the general relationship between workout duration, average power, average heart rate, TSS, and rpe?
- Does rpe increase linearly with average power and average heart rate?
- Is it possible to predict rpe based on average power, average heart rate, and workout duration?
